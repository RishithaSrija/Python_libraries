# Python_libraries
# 🧠 Python Data Analysis Project

This project showcases my learning journey with **Python libraries — Pandas and NumPy**, guided by **Karunakar Eede** under **Tekwork Solutions**.

It includes hands-on tasks focused on **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization**, demonstrating the core skills of a data analyst using Python.

## 🚀 What I Learned

* **NumPy** fundamentals — arrays, indexing, slicing, and vectorized operations
* **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis

  * Importing and exploring datasets
  * Handling missing and duplicate values
  * Filtering, grouping, and sorting data
  * Aggregations and correlations
  * Merging and joining multiple datasets
* **Basic Data Cleaning** — identifying outliers, handling inconsistencies
* **Descriptive Statistics** using `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`, and correlation analysis
* **Exporting Cleaned Data** to CSV/Excel

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **NumPy**
* **Pandas**
* **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**

## 📊 Key Highlights

* Filtered suspicious transactions and high-revenue orders
* Calculated total revenue, mean order value, and order counts by country
* Used **correlation analysis** to find relationships between `Quantity`, `UnitPrice`, and `Revenue`
* Cleaned and exported the final dataset for further insights
